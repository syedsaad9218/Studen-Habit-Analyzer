# 📚 Student Habit Analyzer  

## 📌 Project Overview  
The **Student Habit Analyzer** is a machine learning project that predicts student academic performance based on daily lifestyle habits such as study hours, sleep duration, and phone usage. Unlike traditional student performance datasets, this project focuses on **behavioral and lifestyle patterns**, making it more unique and practical.

## 🎯 Features  
- Analyze student habits like **study hours, sleep hours, screen time, exercise, etc.**  
- Predict performance category (High, Medium, Low).  
- Visualize important factors affecting performance using graphs.  
- Identify key lifestyle improvements for better academic outcomes.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Python**  
- **Pandas, NumPy,** → Data cleaning & manipulation  
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly** → Data visualization  
- **Scikit-learn** → ML models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest)

## 📂 Dataset  
You can either:  
- Created a **mock dataset** with synthetic data representing student habits and performance. 
- Generate synthetic data in Python.  

**Example columns**:  
- `study_hours`  
- `sleep_hours`  
- `phone_usage`  
- `exercise_time`  
- `attendance`  
- `performance (label)`

## 📊 Workflow  
1. **Input**: Student daily habit data (study hours, sleep, phone usage, etc.)  
2. **Preprocessing**: Clean and normalize data, handle missing values  
3. **EDA**: Visualize trends and correlations between habits and performance  
4. **Model Training**: Train ML models to classify performance (Low / Medium / High)  
5. **Prediction**: Given new habit data → predict performance  
6. **Output**: Prediction results + feature importance insights
